\f2\b0\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 Al-Lail\'a0contrasts the\'a0nature of\'a0charitable, God-fearing individuals\'a0with those\'a0who are\'a0miserly\'a0and disbelieving. It\'a0begins by\'a0swearing by\'a0the\'a0night, the\'a0day, and the creation of\'a0male and\'a0female, illustrating that\'a0human actions\'a0also contrast\'a0like these\'a0natural phenomena. The\'a0surah\'a0teaches\'a0that\'a0those who\'a0give generously\'a0and fear\'a0Allah will\'a0be eased\'a0into ease, while\'a0those who\'a0are greedy\'a0and think\'a0themselves self-sufficient\'a0will be\'a0eased into\'a0hardship. It emphasizes\'a0that ultimate\'a0success comes\'a0from purifying oneself\'a0and remembering\'a0the name\'a0of one's Lord, leading\'a0a life\'a0of righteousness\'a0guided by\'a0divine revelation.\

\f2\b0\fs26 \cf4 \cb5 Ad-Duha\'a0was revealed\'a0at a\'a0time when\'a0there was\'a0a brief\'a0interruption in\'a0revelation, and the\'a0Prophet Muhammad\'a0felt distressed.

It reminds\'a0him of\'a0his past, how\'a0Allah found\'a0him\'a0orphaned and gave him\'a0refuge, found him\'a0unaware and\'a0guided him, and\'a0found him\'a0in need\'a0and made\'a0him self-sufficient. The\'a0chapter concludes\'a0by advising\'a0the Prophet\'a0to treat\'a0the orphan\'a0with kindness\'a0and not\'a0to repel the\'a0beggar, emphasizing\'a0gratitude and\'a0compassion.\
